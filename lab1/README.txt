All the code works.

Question 1.
Firstly to get the number of arrays to be sorted create a variable and store the subtraction of first from last . Then a new array can be created as the amount of numbers have been found and the for loop will be used to copy the data to the new array with the conditions of the first and last numbers for the range, and the specified data will be copied to the new array which will then be sent to mySort along with the number of values in the new array.
The code will look like:


mySort(int d[], n){

betterSort(d, 0, n-1);                          
    
}

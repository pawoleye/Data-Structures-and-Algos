The code works fine both parrt 1 and 2.

If stand-alone tags were used, in part one firstly i will read the tag name starting after '<', then all the string gets pushed to the stack, then when the input of '/' is read, the string that's between < and / gets popped as it is stand alone and another tag cannot be between the start and end.
